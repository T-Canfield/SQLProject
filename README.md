# SQLProject

First project after learning SQL within the Sparta Global Academy to build on understanding of coding in SQL and writing queries.
These queries included multiple joins as well as subqueries to allow us to experiment with what we had learned in the week 
focusing on SQL.

The topics covered include:
-Normalisation (1st, 2nd and 3rd NF) and the considerations of databases.

-DML (Data Manipulation Language), DDL (Data Definition Language), DCL (Data Control Language) and TCL (Transactional Control Language).

-The logical and Processing sequence of SQL. 

-The different data types used within SQL. 

-Table Relationships through the use of foreign keys and ERDs (Entity Relationship Diagrams).

The features that we used included creating new and modifying existing schema as well as creating queries. These queries included
JOIN (all different types of join including joins across multiple tables), functions (such as count, sum, max, min etc), TOP.
